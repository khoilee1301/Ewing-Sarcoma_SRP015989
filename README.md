Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive malignancy that arises in bone or soft tissue and commonly presents with pain, swelling, or palpable masses, most often in the legs or pelvis. Over 85% of Ewing sarcoma cases are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS–FLI, which is widely regarded as the primary driver of tumor initiation and progression. As such, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which EWS–FLI alters gene regulation is essential for elucidating Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis, gaining broader insight into ETS-associated cancers, and identifying potential therapeutic targets.
