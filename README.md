# Ewing Sarcoma
---
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive malignancy that arises in bone or soft tissue and commonly presents with pain, swelling, or palpable masses, most often in the legs or pelvis. Over 85% of Ewing sarcoma cases are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein EWS–FLI, which is widely regarded as the primary driver of tumor initiation and progression. As such, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which EWS–FLI alters gene regulation is essential for elucidating Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis, gaining broader insight into ETS-associated cancers, and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

In this project, I analyzed publicly available RNA-sequencing data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number PRJNA176544), generated by the Huntsman Cancer Institute. The objective of this study was to investigate how EWS–FLI regulates gene expression in Ewing sarcoma by examining the effects of EWS–FLI knockdown. The dataset consists of seven samples, including three control samples and four EWS–FLI knockdown samples. After downloading the count matrix from NCBI, I performed differential gene expression analysis to identify genes that are significantly altered between conditions. These genes were subsequently annotated and analyzed at the pathway level to better understand which biological functions and pathways are restored following EWS–FLI knockdown.

Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals a clear separation between control (shCTR) and EWS–FLI knockdown (shEF1) samples, with PC1 explaining 98% of the total variance. This indicates that EWS–FLI knockdown is the primary driver of transcriptional variation in this dataset. In addition, biological replicates cluster tightly within each condition, suggesting high data quality and minimal batch effects.
